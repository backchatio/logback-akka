# A couple of akka based logback utilities

Implements a logback appender and layout for the following items:  

  * ActorAppender
  * HoptoadActorAppender
  * Graylog2 Actor based GELF appender
  
This is pretty much a work in progress at this point. if those three appenders are implemented then I'll publish it to scala-tools.
